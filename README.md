# Login Registration System

## Description
Coded a secure login program in C++ with a focus on object-oriented design and modularity. The program saves usernames to a .dat file and employs encryption to keep passwords safe. I also demonstrated proficiency in file I/O, debugging, algorithmic design, and user interface development.

### Lessons Learned
- Working with the fstream class.
- Creating, accessing, and modifying files.
- Handling command-line input and output.
- Creation of basic encryption algorithm.
